<p>I wrote this application to teach myself <a href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>.  The game is very
well-known - at least in Western countries - every schoolchild learns it.  And it's probably
some sort of early developmental milestone to realize that played properly, it is virtually
impossible to lose.  Thus, I think most of us lose interest in it as it's a game notorious
for draws.</p>
